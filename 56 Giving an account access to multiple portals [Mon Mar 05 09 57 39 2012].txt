To give an account multi-portal access, and to give it ADMIN rights:


rclick table dbo.UserPortals, edit top 200

CTRL 1 - table 
CTRL 2 - columns
CTRL 3 - query 

Use CTRL -3

Modify it to:

SELECT     TOP (200) UserId, PortalId, UserPortalId, CreatedDate, Authorised
FROM         UserPortals where UserId=25464

(
NOTE:  you get the UserId by doing a query on the dbo.Users table:

SELECT * FROM dbo.Users WHERE Lastname='Husiak' AND FirstName = 'Kyle'

)

Note:   you need to press the '!' button.  f5 doesnt work.

Now you can hand bomb in the Userid, PortalID, CreateDate, Authorised:

UserId	PortalId	UserPortalId	CreatedDate	Authorised
25464	3		25595		01:36.9		1
""	0			
""	4			

Next step is the roles.  The ADMIN role is role 0.

EDIT top 200 of dbo.UserRoles.  CTRL-3

Modify query:

SELECT     TOP (200) UserRoleID, UserID, RoleID, ExpiryDate, IsTrialUsed, EffectiveDate
FROM         UserRoles
WHERE     (UserID = 25464)

Add the 0 role.

NOTE:  this should create Kyle with admin on every portal he is connected too.
