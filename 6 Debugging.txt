Attaching to running process

Since a simple run will cause a complete rebuild and cause a lot of issues (e.g. build time is 10 minutes) we use attach to process.

Under Debug, select Attach to process.

You will see a list of all the processes active. We are looking for the asp worker process, typically:

aspnet_wp.exe

Once this is connected, you can set break points in your code as per usual.
