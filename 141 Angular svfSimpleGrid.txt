===SimpleGrid===

Angular widget for displaying data in a table. includes hiding, removal and excel export.
It has partial functionality in IE8 (Excel export doesn't work, and will alert the user to this).

Document assumes you know how to create an angular app, are familiar with controllers and directives,
and have a passing knowledge of how flaky IE8 is.

This is a work in progress.


=== Description ===


=== Configuration ===

In your app.js (or whereever you set up your angular app), approx:

  (function () { angular.module('App', ['svfSimpleGrid']) })();

In your markup (.ascx) you need (approx):

        
      <dnn:DnnJsInclude ID="DnnJsSimpleGrid" 
        runat="server" 
        FilePath="~/js/custom_angular/simplegrid/SimpleGridController.js" 
        ForceProvider="DnnFormBottomProvider" 
        Priority="227" />


        
===Usage===

Assuming you have bound, in your controller (e.g. SampleDataContoller), the following:

    $scope.rowstart - which row to start the display at
    $scope.rowend   - which row to end the display at
    $scope.tools    - boolean, display the tools (sort desc, sort asc, remove ) on the table
    $scope.records  - array of similair objects for displaying in a table
    
    <div class="latin-table" ng-controller="SampleDataController">
        <div simple-grid="" records="records" start="rowstart" end="rowend" tools="tools"/>
    </div>
    
This will display three buttons as well:
[UNHIDE COLUMNS] - this will unhide any columns you had hidden  
[RESET]          - this unhides, and removes any sorting you applied
[EXCEL]          - this exports the visible content to excel (not the controls). Does not work in IE8


==Skinning===

This is largely up to you. What I do, assuming above classes are used,  is drop this in the app.css file:

    .latin-table table
    {
        border: solid 1px black;
    }
    .latin-table thead td
    {
        font-weight:bolder;
        background-color:lightgreen;
    }
    .latin-table td
    {
        border: solid 1px black;
    
    }
    .latin-table td
    {
        color: green;
    }
