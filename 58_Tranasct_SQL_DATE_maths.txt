To calculate the number <units> between two dates:

  SELECT  DATEDIFF(hour, '2005-12-31 18:59:59', '2006-01-01 00:00:00') 

You can replace hour with day, year, minute etc etc

To do arithmetic on a date:

  SELECT DATEADD(year,-1, '2006-06-01') AS "-1 Year";

You can get todays date using:

  SELECT GETDATE()


Combining these, you can get one day prior today by:

  SELECT DATEADD(DAY,-1,GETDATE())
