Adding modules.

For this example I have premade the page with an HTML placeholder, and already 
created the ASCX page - which is the same as DNN4.


tbaytel modules go in a directory called:

	...\DesktopModules\TbayTel\<module name>


Log in as a HOST account
goto:  HOST>Extensions
click the [Manage] widget located in the left hand corner of the modules. 
(note: this is transparent until you hover on it.)
Click 'Create New Module'

From:  Control
Owner Folder: TbayTel
Module Folder: ViewBill
Resource:  ViewBill.ascx
Module Name: ViewBill    (note:  this is what you see when you go to add the module to a page.)
Description : eg.


	This is a my.tbaytel.net module for allowing registered 
	customers to view their bills

Add test Page?  [ ] (no)

[Create Module]

Next, find your module on the Modules page and edit it.
(click the pencil)

Module Category  [ pulldown to myTbaytel ]    (*** note:  this is controlled through the ADMIN> TAXONOMY module, 
                                                   in case we want to add more categories *****)

[Update Extension]
[X] close the window.


Goto the page you want to add it to.   (**** note you can add pages from the ADMIN>Page Management screen ****)

select Modules, category: myTbaytel, drop yours into the Content pane
Note:  there may be a placeholder, like an HTML module. If you click the Manage button in that
       modules panel, you can delete it.
