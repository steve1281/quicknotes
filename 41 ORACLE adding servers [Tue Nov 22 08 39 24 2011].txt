To add a system to connection to Oracle SQL Developer (version 3)
click the +


Connection Name:  TBYSSTS2
Username:   crm
Password:  - this will vary, crm is a good guess -
Connection Type:  TNS

everything else is as is where is.

---------------------------

when running oracle scripts using the already installed oracle client

you need an entry in a file called tnsnames.ora

this obscure file is in directory:

   C:\Oracle\product\10.2.0\client_1\NETWORK\ADMIN

Its a flat file, and you can see the format fairly quickly:


Example:


TBYSSTS2 =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = phoenix)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = tbyssts2.tbaytel.com)
    )
  )
