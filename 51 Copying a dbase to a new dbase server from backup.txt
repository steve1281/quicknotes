*** caveat From Database to same Database is trickyer :-)

Copying a dbase to a new dbase server from backup:
- backup

\SQL\_DBBackups\<dbname>

copy files to target system (with the database on it)
files are the most recent .BAK file

connect to the dbase server

create a dbase withthe same name as the original

rclick - tasks - restore - database
from device - file (find it)

[x] Restore

goto the Options panel (top left)

[x] Overwrite the exisiting database
NOTE: if the database names are different, this is tricky.

click [OK]

dnn6_mytbaytel

and

tbaytel


Get backup:  \\tbtappdev\d$\SQL\_DBBackups\dnn6_mytbaytel\dnn6_mytbaytel_backup_2012_02_28_040002_1981101.bak

 - copied to desktop of local machine

rdp tbtextranettest
copy file above to its desktop

Sometimes, if the database already exisited and you renamed, you may get an error message.

Instead of renaming, drop the stupid thing.
Make sure you say to close existing connetions
be carefull!
