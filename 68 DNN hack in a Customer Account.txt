Hacking in a Customer.


1. Get the userid for the targetted user
2. add a row to the tbt.customer table
3. get the customer id for the row added
4. add a row to the tbt.customeraccount table
  - note the isactive = 1
  - accountstatus is (probably) 3 (active). Could also be 2 (new). 
5. login as admin and use the User Accounts to assign the "Customer" role.
  - DNN 4  sometimes gives us errors when we do this.
