The databases to be compacted are in  \\nugget\workorder$

\WO_Program\WOProgramI\WorkOrderTracking.mdb
\WO_Program\WOProgramJ\WorkOrderTracking.mdb
\WO_Program\WOProgramK\WorkOrderTracking.mdb

The process used:

1. Note the current file size.  It will be ~1200 KB

2. Open the file (identified above) using MS Access.
- note the password request can be ignored.

3. Tools -> Database Utilities -> Compact and Repair Database
- the screen will flicker; no other change is apparent.

4. Exit and note the file size will be ~800 KB


The process takes < 5 mins, but does require that the database files not be locked (so no one can be using them).  If the file is locked, you will  get an error message.  You can also check for the existance of a file:  WorkOrderTracking.ldb  in the same directory as database files.  The only way to unlock is to make sure that no one is using the database file.
