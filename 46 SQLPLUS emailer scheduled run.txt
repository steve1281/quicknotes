Jobs are scheduled from tbtapplive. You can find them (if your app as PINFailureActivity):

   \\tbtapplive\e$\Jobs\Eagle\TBayTel\ScheduledReports\PINFailureActivity


There is a batch file : PINFailureActivity.bat  that you would schedule.
The target database to run against is: Database_List.txt
The email targets are  in : Mail_Recipients.txt

NOTES: there should also be a test configuration (files are prefixed Test).

--------------------------------

Need to set up the processing_parameter table:

1. Create new entry:

insert into processing_parameter values
('PIN FAILURE QUERY DATE', sysdate-60, 'Last time the PIN Failure Activity Report was reported', 'JCOOPER',sysdate, 'JCOOPER',sysdate);

2. Update as required (ie. when you are testing you will need to retest):

update processing_parameter
set prp_parameter_value = sysdate -60
where prp_parameter_key = 'PIN FAILURE QUERY DATE';

3. You can query the latest run:

select * from processing_parameter
where prp_parameter_key = 'PIN FAILURE QUERY DATE';
