===Intermediate Angular tricks  ===

    Document describing collection of tricks we can do with angular.js

    The reader should be familiar with building .NET applications and DNN IPC. An understanding of 
    basic javascript (refer to "132 Javascript Notes.txt") is needed.  "133 Merging DNN with Angular.txt" is
    a good reference here as well. Probably need "134 Example of Angular-DNN application.txt" too.

=== Terms ===
   View - piece of markup with an app and a controller encasing it.
   Model - $scope.  variable in a controller.
   Controller - code that connects the view to the model
   
=== Rules of Thumb ===

      
=== Dump model on view ===

  If your controller has a model like:
    $scope.name = "John Smith";
  
  You can put it on the view:
    <p>Hello {{name}} </p>
    
=== Dump an array on the view ====  

    <div ng-repeat="record in records">
        <p>
            <strong>{{record.FriendlyName}}</strong>
            {{record.BillPoint}} 
            {{record.Email}}
        </p>
    </div>

=== Trigger a method in the controller ===
    
    <div ng-click="play(0)">
    
    </div>
    
=== Select css class based on model ===

   <div ng-class="{'ttt-X':Xes[0],'ttt-O':Oes[0]}">

   </div>
