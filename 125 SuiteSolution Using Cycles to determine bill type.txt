The other option would be to look at the Cycle.  

Cycles 1,2,3,10 and 20 are Mobility.  


Cycles 71,72 & 73 are Telecommunications.  

Cycle 75 is Security.  


This may change at some point in the future, but we are talking years if ever.

If you only have Bill Group which is a value on the BILLING_POINT table, you can get the cycle by joining the BILL_GROUP table.  Here are the important fields:
      
   
   
----------------------------

@websiteUnregisters - billpointid, deletedate 

@ebillingSubs - ebilling signups/

@UNebillingSubs - ebilling unsignups


AND CYC_CYCLE_ID IN (1,2,3,10,20) -- mobility
AND CYC_CYCLE_ID IN (71,72,73)    -- telecom
AND CYC_CYCLE_ID IN (75)          -- security




Excample:


-
-- total ebilling signup  TELECOM
--
DECLARE @myTbaytelEbillingTotalTelecomSignup INTEGER
;WITH cte AS 
(
	SELECT 
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY BLP_BILLING_POINT ORDER BY PhoneNumber DESC) AS ROW,
		si.SBR_SERVICE_TYPE, 
		si.BLP_BILLING_POINT, 
		si.PhoneNumber,
		Adddate
	FROM tbt.customeraccount ca 
	JOIN myTbaytel_Repository.ssol.SubscriberInformation si 		ON si.BLP_BILLING_POINT = ca.BillPointID
	JOIN myTbaytel_Repository.ssol.AccountInformation ai ON ai.BLP_BILLING_POINT = ca.BillPointID
	WHERE  IsActive =1 
	
) SELECT  @myTbaytelEbillingTotalTelecomSignup = COUNT(*)   FROM cte
WHERE row = 1
AND CYC_CYCLE_ID IN (71,72,73)    -- telecom
