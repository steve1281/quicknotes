HTML5 - The Filesystem Entity

CHROME only
I have some example code: C:\html5demos\html5wow
Web page: http://localhost/files_5/


The files are stored, as a blob at:

C:\Documents and Settings\svf\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\File System

You can safely delete these once Chrome shuts down.
