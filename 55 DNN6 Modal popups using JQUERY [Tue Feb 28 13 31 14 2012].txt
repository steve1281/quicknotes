DNN6 no longer supports AJAX.  However, JQUERY has an approach which is pretty much the same.



A DIV that will be displayed as a MODAL:

    <div id="dialog" title="Disclaimer">
    ... some content ...


    ... these force a post which removes the modal (and also sets the field in the form I needed) ...

        <center >
          <input id="btnOkay" type="button" value="I Agree" runat="server" causesvalidation="false"  />
          <input id="btnCancel" type="button" value="I Disagree" runat="server"  causesvalidation="false"    />
        </center>

    </div>



A url to let the user click something:

   <a class="disclaimer" href="#" ><b>IP Relay Service</b></a>


Some jquery, which I put at the end of the ASCX file:

<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function () {
        $("#dialog").dialog({
            autoOpen: false,
            modal: true
        });

        $(".disclaimer").click(function (e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            var targetUrl = $(this).attr("href");

            $("#dialog").dialog("open");
        });

    }); // end of $(document).ready

</script>

... NOTES ...

The div that is being popped is called "dialog".
The class that is controlling is is called "disclaimer".
