(Joe's) style is to create a table, and to place asp elements into the 

e.g.

<table id="tblName" runat="Server">
  <tr>
    <td>Last Name</td>
    <td><asp:Image ID="Image1" runat="server" Height="40px" ImageUrl="~/images/Tbaytel_Images/TBayTelLogo.JPG" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td colspan='2'>
  <asp:DropDownList runat="server" ID="ddlLastName" DataTextField="sbr_last_name"  />
  </td>

  </tr>      
        
</table>

One thing to note, the table has been assigned an ID and a runat even though it is not an ASP entity. This is to allow use to manipulate it in the codebehind. e.g.

  tblName.Visible = Not tblName.Visible


wrt grids, picked 'Snowy Pine' for  CSS, but we had to customize the header(th). A bit fiddly.
